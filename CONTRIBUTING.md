# Contributing to documentation (video, text etc…)
## Videos
There is some [videos tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIsRFoaVQNSl_RlGAZE2mVg/playlists) to describe how scripts works but many are missing.
You can also translate it in your own language. There is already 1 video in french. Add video to your own youtube channel
or send it to me. I will then add it to playlist depending on language (new playlist if new language). Videos must be under

## Text
I try to comment code as much as possible and to use type hints to improve auto control available in IDE as pyCharm but 
there is no real standalone documentation produced yet. You might want to generate one using Sphinx or simple README.md 
in each folder, or just correct typos ?

# Contributing to source code

You want to help but don't know how to code check 
[Ehsan's course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsXsc2PYLCU&list=PLc_1PNcpnV5742XyF8z7xyL9OF8XJNYnv&index=1) 
and [links on my blog](http://pythoncvc.net/?page_id=302).

# UI/UX
Unless you see small valuable improvements. I don't think it worth working on it too much. I suggest to contribute to 
contribute to a more sustainable/worthy project as [FreeCAD](https://www.freecadweb.org/).
